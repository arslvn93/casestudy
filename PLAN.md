# Dynamic Page Content Plan for index.html

**Overall Goal:**
Transform the static `Personal/SalesGenius/Nick/index.html` page into a dynamic one where content for the header, main summary/sidebar, content sections, and footer is loaded from a new `Personal/SalesGenius/Nick/config.js` file. This will allow easy updates to content, structure (like reordering or adding/removing sections), and reuse of common data elements.

**Phase 1: Define the `config.js` Data Structure**

We'll create a JavaScript file, `Personal/SalesGenius/Nick/config.js`, which will export a single configuration object. This object will be structured as follows:

1.  **`globals` Object:**
    *   Purpose: To store common data points that are reused across multiple sections, avoiding redundancy.
    *   Examples: Company name ("iStreet Realty Group"), agent names and contact details, common Call To Action (CTA) button text ("Book A Discovery Call"), frequently used phrases.
    *   Structure:
        ```javascript
        // In config.js
        const config = {
          globals: {
            companyName: "iStreet Realty Group",
            mainCTAButtonText: "Book A Discovery Call",
            agents: [
              { name: "Rick Roccasalva", email: "rick@istreelrealty.ca", phone: "(416) 616-9369", /* other details */ },
              { name: "Steven Simonetti", email: "steven@istreelrealty.ca", phone: "(416) 400-7653", /* other details */ }
            ],
            // ... other global values
          },
          // ... other top-level config sections
        };
        ```

2.  **`header` Object:**
    *   Purpose: To define the content for the main page header.
    *   Properties: `tag`, `title`, `subheadline` (can be HTML string), `ctaButtonTextRef` (referencing `globals`).
    *   Example:
        ```javascript
        // In config.js (part of the main config object)
        header: {
          tag: "CASE STUDY",
          title: "How We Helped an Investor Win a 10-Offer Bidding War and Secure a Cash-Flowing Duplex in Vaughan",
          subheadline: "Purchased in a <strong>High-Demand Area</strong> With Strong Terms—Now <a href=\"#\" style=\"color:#fff;text-decoration:underline;font-weight:600;\">Generating Top-Dollar Rent</a> in a Tight Market",
          ctaButtonTextRef: "mainCTAButtonText" // Refers to globals.mainCTAButtonText
        },
        ```

3.  **`mainBox` Object:**
    *   Purpose: To define content for the two-column section containing the summary and sidebar.
    *   Properties:
        *   `summary`: Object with `title`, `heroImage` (src, alt), `subTitle` (for the H3), `paragraphs` (array of HTML strings), `ctaButtonTextRef`.
        *   `sidebar`: Object with `image` (src, alt), `title` (can reference `globals.companyName`), `paragraphs` (array of HTML strings), `contacts` (array of objects, each can reference `globals.agents` or define directly).
    *   Example:
        ```javascript
        // In config.js (part of the main config object)
        mainBox: {
          summary: {
            title: "How We Helped an Investor Win a 10-Offer Bidding War and Secure a Cash-Flowing Duplex in Vaughan",
            heroImage: { src: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506744038136-46273834b3fb?fit=crop&w=800&q=80", alt: "Duplex Vaughan" },
            subTitle: "Summary",
            paragraphs: [
              "In one of Vaughan’s most competitive pockets, a <strong>savvy investor client was looking for a cash-flowing, turn-key property to build long-term generational wealth</strong>. The challenge: high demand, limited inventory, and bidding wars on nearly every listing worth seeing.",
              "After viewing 8 homes, we found a <strong>rare 2-unit property in Woodbridge</strong> underlisted at $999k to spark competition. The listing drew 10 offers—but through strategic negotiation, a larger deposit, firm terms, and a quick close... we won the deal at $1.26M without needing to be the highest bid. The property has since been <strong>rented at top market value</strong>, exceeding the client’s expectations and <strong>setting the foundation for strong equity gains</strong> in the years to come."
            ],
            ctaButtonTextRef: "mainCTAButtonText"
          },
          sidebar: {
            image: { src: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511367461989-f85a21fda167?fit=crop&w=200&q=80", alt: "iStreet Realty Agents" },
            titleRef: "companyName", // Refers to globals.companyName
            paragraphs: [
              "At iStreet Realty Group we are built on integrity, insight, and innovation.<br><br>We combine decades of real estate expertise with cutting-edge technology to deliver unmatched support, transparency, and results for our clients.<br><br>With over 40 years of hands-on real estate experience and extensive corporate backgrounds, our managing partners provide a balanced and strategic approach to Residential, Commercial, and Investment properties.<br><br>We prioritize clear communication and use the latest market insights to guide every client toward success—whether buying, selling, or investing.<br><strong>At iStreet Realty Inc., we're more than real estate experts—we're your trusted partner in building your future.</strong>"
            ],
            contacts: [ // Can reference globals.agents or define inline
              { type: "email", valueRef: "agents.0.email", iconSvg: "<path d='...'/>" }, // Example structure
              { type: "phone", valueRef: "agents.0.phone", iconSvg: "<path d='...'/>" },
              // ... more contacts
            ]
          }
        },
        ```

4.  **`sections` Array:**
    *   Purpose: To define the main content sections of the page. The order of objects in this array will determine the display order.
    *   Each object in the array will represent one section and have properties like:
        *   `type`: (String) To differentiate rendering logic (e.g., "standard", "cta", "testimonialWithinStandard").
        *   `title`: (String, optional) For the section's `<h3>`.
        *   `paragraphs`: (Array of HTML strings, optional).
        *   `image`: (Object, optional) `{ src: "url", alt: "text" }`.
        *   `listItems`: (Array of HTML strings, optional).
        *   `testimonial`: (Object, optional, for sections that *contain* a testimonial) `{ quote: "HTML string", author: "string", style: "string" }`.
        *   `ctaContent`: (Object, optional, for dedicated CTA sections) `{ text: "HTML string", buttonTextRef: "string" }`.
    *   Example:
        ```javascript
        // In config.js (part of the main config object)
        sections: [
          {
            type: "standard",
            title: "The Challenge",
            paragraphs: [
              "This investor client had a clear goal: <strong>find a cash-flowing, turn-key duplex in one of Vaughan’s most desirable neighborhoods—Woodbridge.</strong> Out in a market filled with bidding wars and underlisted homes designed to spark competition, finding the right property and <strong>winning it without overpaying was no small feat.</strong>",
              "The biggest challenge? <strong>Every worthwhile home had multiple offers</strong>, and this buyer was competing with aggressive bids from both investors and end-users. There was also <strong>lingering uncertainty around whether a property like this could attract renters at top value</strong>, which could make or break the deal financially."
            ]
          },
          {
            type: "standard", // Or a more specific type if styling differs significantly
            title: "The Strategy",
            paragraphs: [ /* ... */ ],
            testimonial: { // Embedded testimonial
              quote: "“I had an amazing experience working with Rick & Steven at iStreet Realty Group. Communication and follow-through were prompt every step. Negotiating the winning offer was about strategy, not just price!”<br><span style=\"font-size:0.95em;color:#666;\">— Vaughan Investor</span>",
              // author: "Vaughan Investor" // Could be separate if needed
            }
          },
          {
            type: "cta",
            ctaContent: {
              text: "<div style=\"font-weight:700;\">Find Out More About Working With Rick Roccasalva and Steven Simonetti at iStreet Realty Group</div>",
              buttonTextRef: "mainCTAButtonText"
            }
          }
          // ... more sections
        ],
        ```

5.  **`footer` Object:**
    *   Purpose: To define the content for the page footer.
    *   Properties: `logo` (src, alt), `brokerageText` (HTML string), `brokerageLogo` (src, alt, style), `disclaimer` (HTML string), `privacyPolicyLink` (text, href).
    *   Example:
        ```javascript
        // In config.js (part of the main config object)
        footer: {
          logo: { src: "https://i.imgur.com/0tK4Dlt.png", alt: "iStreet Realty Logo" },
          brokerageText: "<strong>Brokerage:</strong> Homelife Partners Realty Corp.<br>",
          brokerageLogo: { src: "https://i.imgur.com/9GIzqTo.png", alt: "Homelife Luxury", style: "max-width:60px;margin:0.7em 0 0.5em 0;" },
          disclaimer: "All testimonials on this page are from real clients.

          privacyPolicyLink: { text: "Privacy Policy", href: "#" }
        }
        // Make sure to close the main config object
        // }; // End of const config
        ```

**Phase 2: Modify `Personal/SalesGenius/Nick/index.html`**

1.  **Create Placeholder Elements:**
    *   The existing static content for the header, main box, sections, and footer will be removed.
    *   In their places, we'll add empty container elements with unique IDs:
        *   Header: `<header id="dynamic-header"></header>` (replacing content around lines 268-273).
        *   Main Box:
            *   Within the existing `.main-box` div (around line 276):
                *   `<section class="main-content" id="dynamic-main-content"></section>` (replacing content of current `.main-content`).
                *   `<aside class="sidebar" id="dynamic-sidebar"></aside>` (replacing content of current `.sidebar`).
        *   Sections Container: `<div id="dynamic-sections-container"></div>` (this will go *after* the `.main-box` div, and will contain the dynamically generated sections that are currently from line 311 to 374).
        *   Footer: `<footer id="dynamic-footer"></footer>` (replacing content around lines 376-388).

2.  **Include Scripts:**
    *   Add a script tag to load the configuration: `<script src="config.js"></script>` (assuming it's in the same directory).
    *   Add a script tag for the rendering logic (either inline or a new `renderer.js` file): `<script src="renderer.js"></script>`.
    *   These should be placed before the closing `</body>` tag, with `config.js` loaded before `renderer.js`.
        ```html
        <!-- Before </body> -->
        <script src="config.js"></script>
        <script src="renderer.js"></script> <!-- or <script> ...inline JS... </script> -->
        </body>
        ```

**Phase 3: Create `Personal/SalesGenius/Nick/config.js`**

*   This new file will contain the JavaScript `config` object as defined in Phase 1.
*   The content will be meticulously extracted from the current static `Personal/SalesGenius/Nick/index.html` and structured into the `globals`, `header`, `mainBox`, `sections` array, and `footer` objects. HTML for bolding, links, etc., within text content will be preserved as strings.
*   The file should start with `const config = {` and end with `};`.

**Phase 4: Implement JavaScript Rendering Logic (in `renderer.js` or inline script)**

1.  **Main Function:**
    *   A function (e.g., `initializePageContent`) will execute after the DOM is fully loaded (`DOMContentLoaded` event).
    *   It will access the `config` object (which will be global if `config.js` just defines `const config = ...;`).

2.  **Renderer Functions (Conceptual):**
    *   `renderHeader(headerData, globalsData)`: Generates HTML for the header and injects it into `#dynamic-header`.
    *   `renderMainBox(mainBoxData, globalsData)`:
        *   Calls `renderSummary(summaryData, globalsData)` to populate `#dynamic-main-content`.
        *   Calls `renderSidebar(sidebarData, globalsData)` to populate `#dynamic-sidebar`.
    *   `renderSections(sectionsArray, globalsData)`:
        *   Iterates through `config.sections`.
        *   For each section object, calls a generic `renderSingleSection(sectionData, globalsData)` function.
        *   Appends the generated HTML for each section to `#dynamic-sections-container`.
    *   `renderSingleSection(sectionData, globalsData)`:
        *   Uses `sectionData.type` (e.g., "standard", "cta") to determine the specific HTML structure (e.g., `<div class="section"><div class="section-inner">...</div></div>` or `<div class="section"><div class="cta-section">...</div></div>`).
        *   Will call sub-helper functions like `createParagraphsHTML`, `createImageHTML`, `createListHTML`, `createTestimonialHTML` as needed.
    *   `renderFooter(footerData, globalsData)`: Generates HTML for the footer and injects it into `#dynamic-footer`.

3.  **Data Handling & HTML:**
    *   Rendering functions will use `element.innerHTML = ...` to inject generated HTML.
    *   HTML strings from the config (e.g., in `paragraphs` or `listItems`) will be directly used. Care must be taken to ensure they are valid HTML.
    *   References like `globals.companyName` will be resolved.
