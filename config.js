        "After viewing 8 homes, we found a <strong>rare 2-unit property in Woodbridge</strong> underlisted at $999k to spark competition. The listing drew 10 offers—but through strategic negotiation, a larger deposit, firm terms, and a quick close... we won the deal at $1.26M without needing to be the highest bid. The property has since been <strong>rented at top market value</strong>, exceeding the client’s expectations and <strong>setting the foundation for strong equity gains</strong> in the years to come."
